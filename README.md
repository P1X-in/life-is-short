- collect additional coins for points
- bugs will try to hit you that will make you smaller
- biggest enemy is a riven
  - rivens fly above, you only see a shadow
  - when the shadow is over you there is a chanve that riven will hunt you
  - the bigger you are the bigger chance
  - try to hide and avoid rivens
